# About

This is a stories feature project inspired by the stories look in [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com). It is meant to demonstrate firebase usage in an iOS app, the project uses an MVVM architecture, [Signals](https://github.com/artman/Signals.git) to observe events and client-side image caching for faster loading of stories already viewed. The choice of Signals over RxSwift is because Signals is lightweight and provides reactive features like RxSwift with less boilerplate code.
